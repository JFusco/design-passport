## Context wiki

Use `wiki/` as this repository's durable record of executed plans, decisions, and substantive change history. Never bulk-load `wiki/`.

- For an exact current-code, file, symbol, or command question, inspect the named source or use targeted source `rg`; do not load history.
- For a direct single-topic history or rationale question, start at `wiki/INDEX.md` when it exists and open only the page it routes to.
- Only for a cross-page why, wiring, ownership, or impact question, run `node scripts/wiki/navigate.cjs --intent why --query "<terms>"` before opening wiki pages. Use `wiring` for ownership/dependencies and `impact` for change scope.
- Query with exact slugs, identifiers, symbols, or repository-qualified GitHub references. Never use a bare issue or PR number such as `#123`.
- When both endpoints are known, use exact `--from` and `--to` node IDs.
- Trust the router's deterministic weighted shortest route, which accounts for relationship cost, hubs, and page bytes. Open only its itinerary; never add candidates, neighbors, or adjacent pages.
- Read itinerary pages sequentially, never speculatively in parallel, and stop as soon as the answer is grounded.
- If resolution is ambiguous, rerun with one returned exact ID; never open every candidate.
- Never use `grep`, `find`, or recursive `rg` as initial wiki discovery. After a router miss, run at most one root-scoped exact search: `rg -n --fixed-strings "<exact term>" wiki/`. If it fails, inspect one known source path or ask one focused question; never widen the search.
- Never read generated graph JSON directly.
- After executing a Claude, Codex, or Cursor plan, archive it and add the journal/topic updates in the same delivery per `wiki/MECHANICS.md`.
- Run `node scripts/wiki/discover-plans.cjs` to recover missed plans, `node scripts/wiki/build-graph.cjs` after wiki edits, and `node scripts/wiki/check.cjs` before completion.
- The Sigma.js graph indexes only Markdown under `wiki/`; never add code nodes.

This managed block was installed for Codex, Cursor, and Claude (via `@AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md`).
